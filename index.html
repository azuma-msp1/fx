			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<h3>Want to make money without working hard?</h3>
					<p>Have you ever wanted to get a life that doesn't bother you with money? But you're busy with work, housework, and parenting, and you don't have time to do side jobs. I hope this article will be useful to you.<br>
						<br>
						If you practice the methods presented on this page, the system will automatically make money while you work, have fun with family and friends, and even while you sleep.<br>
						<br>
						Do you have an image of high risk and high return when you hear FX? That's right. No matter how much money you may make, you will not be able to invest your precious money if you are at risk of losing it in a blink of an eye.<br>
						<br>
						The method I will introduce from now on is aimed at operation with as little risk as possible, but due to the nature of Forex, the risk will never be zero. Please understand the above and decide whether to use this method at your own risk. In my opinion, it's well worth a try!<br>
						<br>
						This is enough for the introduction, so from the next page, I will explain how to increase the money you aim for by automatic trading, how to open an FX account, and how to introduce an automatic trading tool.

					2. High leverage up to 888: 1<br>
					Perhaps some of the readers of this article have the image that high leverage is dangerous. However, high leverage is not always dangerous. With the same balance and the same number of trading lots, the higher the leverage, the higher the margin maintenance rate, and rather the risk of loss cut (forced settlement of unrealized losses) is lower. The higher the leverage, the more lots you can trade with the same source, so if you try to trade many lots, you will be exposed to the risk of loss cut, but keep it above a certain balance and keep the number of trading lots down. It is possible to reduce the risk by doing so.<br>
					<br>
					3. Negative balance reset<br>
					Even if a loss larger than the balance of the XM account is confirmed by the loss cut, the minus amount of the balance of the XM account will be reset to zero, so you will not be obliged to compensate for the loss from your bank account. Even if the amount of money you invested is zero, you will not lose any more money. This is a great relief factor. If you deposit a large amount of money at the very beginning, withdraw the profit of automatic trading diligently and fix the profit, and then manage the profit obtained by automatic trading as a source, you can reduce the risk. It is possible to.

			<h2>1. Overview of how to make money</h2>
				<br>
				<p>(1) Open a new Forex account with XM Trading<br>
					(2) With $ 1000 as the starting point, operate automatic trading and increase the FX account balance to $ 2000 (approximate: 4-5 weeks)<br>
					(3) Open an additional account with XM Trading, transfer $ 1000 of the balance to the additional account, and operate automatic trading with 2 accounts<br>
					(4) While making sure to collect profits by withdrawing frequently on the way, open additional accounts and operate automatic trading with multiple accounts using the profits of existing accounts as the source of new additional accounts.<br>
					(5) Since it is possible to open up to 8 accounts with XM, operate automatic trading with 8 accounts and withdraw the earned amount diligently to confirm profits (approximate: 8 accounts x $ 200 / week x 4 weeks [1 month] ] = $ 6,400 / month)<br>

				<p>
				point<br>
				・ Invest with the preparedness that the first $ 1000 can be zero at worst<br>
				(Even if $ 1000 is inevitable, you need at least $ 500, but the less money you have, the higher the risk of losing money due to loss cuts.)<br>
				・ After that, instead of using your deposit for additional investment, you can use the amount you earned through automatic trading for additional investment.<br>
				・ Keep at least $ 1000 in balance in one account<br>
				・ Keep the minimum number of lots of automated trading tools (EA: Expert Advisor) at 0.01 and do not increase it.<br>
